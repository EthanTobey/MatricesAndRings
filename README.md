# Mathematical Rings and Matrices

## Overview

This Java project implements mathematical structures for matrices and rings, with additional support for polynomials. It is designed to provide efficient operations on these structures, especially focusing on sparse matrices and the flexibility of ring elements. The project is divided into three packages:

- **MatrixPackage**: Provides a map-based implementation of matrices, including operations like instantiation, addition, and multiplication. The package also supports sparse matrices for optimized performance when dealing with matrices containing mostly empty entries.
  
- **RingsPackage**: Defines a hierarchy of ring types to support operations on various data types. It includes the ability to perform addition and multiplication across different ring structures, as well as a specialized `Polynomial` class for polynomial mathematics.

- **TestingPackage**: Contains comprehensive JUnit tests that ensure full code and branch coverage for the functionality within both the `MatrixPackage` and `RingsPackage`.

## Key Features

- **Matrix Operations**: Support for common matrix operations such as addition and multiplication, implemented through a flexible interface hierarchy.
  
- **Sparse Matrix Implementation**: Optimized sparse matrix operations for better performance on matrices with a high number of zero entries.
  
- **Ring Structures**: A hierarchy of ring types that allow for flexible mathematical computations, supporting operations across different data types.
  
- **Polynomial Support**: An implementation of polynomial structures within the ring package, enabling polynomial-based computations.

- **Full Test Coverage**: JUnit tests provide complete code and branch coverage, ensuring reliability and correctness of the implemented algorithms.
